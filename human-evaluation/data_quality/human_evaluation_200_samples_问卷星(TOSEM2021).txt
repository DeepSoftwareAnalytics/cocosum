Generated Summary 1 : Check the feasibility of the candidate pair { n m } . A candidate pair is syntactically feasible iff all k - look - ahead rules hold . These look ahead rules check adjacency relation of the mapping . If an edge is mapped in g1 it should also be mapped in g2 and vise - versa ( 0 - look - ahead ) . If an edge in g1 is unmapped but the edge is adjacent to an another mapped vertex ( terminal ) then the number of such edges should be less or equal in g1 compared to g2 ( 1 - look - ahead ) . If the edge is unmapped and non - terminal then the number of such edges should be less or equal in g1 compared to g2 ( 2 - look - ahead ) . The above feasibility rules are for subgraph - isomorphism and have been adapted for subgraph - monomorphism . For a monomorphism a mapped edge in g2 does not have to be present in g1 . The 2 - look - ahead also requires summing the terminal and remaining counts ( or sorting the vertices ) . The semantic feasibility verifies that the labels the label n m are compatabile and that the label on each matched edge is compatabile . [矩阵题]
